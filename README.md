# iFact

**iFact** is an invoicing web application that I wrote in a spare moment between projects as a personal tool to help me create my invoices having a minimal invoices management.
The name comes as an acronym **i** - letter that was imposed by Apple&trade;&reg; and **Fact**urÄƒ - which means _invoice_ in Romanian ... and also sounds interesting if you pronounce it in a certain way, and this was on purpose.

This is a **S**ingle **P**age **A**pplication written with [Webix](https://webix.com/) framework, running as a couchapp directly
from [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) server. The application
may be synced forth and back from CouchDB to local folder with [AC:zap:DC](https://github.com/iqcouch/acdc) utility.
The invoices are generated as PDF files via [PDFmake](http://pdfmake.org/) framework.

## Install and Setup

Pre-requisites:

* CouchDB version 1.6.1 or later installed. Create `ifact` database and add one user as administrator.
* `git` tool
* **AC**:zap:**DC** tool

Clone this repository to local machine.

git clone https://github.com/iqcouch/ifact.git
```

Copy the `acdc` executable to parent folder of `ifact` and push the application to your CouchDB instance:
